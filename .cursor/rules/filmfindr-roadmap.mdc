# üõ£Ô∏è FilmFindr ‚Äì Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic, phased development plan for FilmFindr. Each phase is designed to build upon the last, progressively delivering the core value proposition of **"delightful relief"** [cite: 3, 307, 389, 425] from streaming decision fatigue. We will iteratively realize the full vision outlined in the `filmfindr-modules.mdc`[cite: 201, 306, 372, 794, 1010], ensuring that every stage embodies the FilmFindr brand essence: **Smart & Insightful, Playful & Engaging, Cinematic & Immersive, and Modern & Stylish**[cite: 5, 308, 390, 427].

## ‚úÖ MVP ‚Äì Phase 1: Core Discovery & Curation Foundation

**Goal:** Launch a focused, polished Minimum Viable Product that delivers immediate value by providing a core AI-driven recommendation experience and essential watchlist functionality. This phase will establish FilmFindr's signature **"Cinematic Minimalism with Personality"** [cite: 16, 308, 316, 340, 345, 362, 385, 401, 406, 411, 417, 438, 516, 529, 541, 570, 578, 652, 670, 687, 738, 752, 762, 767, 785, 903, 916, 928, 957, 965] and introduce users to their **"trusted, stylish, and intelligent guide"**[cite: 3, 307, 388, 425].

### üîê Authentication
-   **Secure User Onboarding:** Implement Firebase Authentication for email/password sign-up and login[cite: 310, 370, 732]. Forms will utilize `Zod` for validation and `react-hook-form`[cite: 312, 313, 353, 370, 734, 735], styled with `shadcn/ui` [cite: 354, 363, 776, 785] components for a seamless, trustworthy experience that aligns with our **"Modern & Stylish"** [cite: 19, 308, 309, 390, 427, 441] personality.
-   **Global Auth Context:** Establish a global context for managing `user`, `loading` state, and `logout()` functionality[cite: 317, 318, 739, 740].
-   **Protected Routes:** Secure core user areas like `/dashboard` by redirecting unauthenticated users[cite: 319, 320, 741, 742].

### üé¨ Movie Discovery (Foundation for the "Intelligent Curator" [cite: 7, 202, 308, 321, 390, 427, 429, 624, 743, 816, 1011])
-   **AI Recommendation Engine (Basic Version):** Introduce the recommendation feed on the `/dashboard`[cite: 322, 357, 744, 779]. For MVP, this may use a curated/seeded dataset [cite: 323, 745] but will be presented to *feel* personalized and intriguing[cite: 324, 746], showcasing the potential of our **"quietly brilliant"** [cite: 8, 203, 308, 321, 395, 430, 625, 743, 817, 1012] AI.
-   **Content Display Cards:** Recommendations will be displayed in elegant cards showing essential information: high-quality poster art, title, genre tags, a brief synopsis, and placeholder streaming availability[cite: 330, 331, 332, 752, 753, 754]. Presentation will use simple **"Cinematic Reveal Animations"**[cite: 135, 210, 333, 632, 755, 1019].
-   **Basic Filtering:** Allow users to refine the feed by core genres, a select few representative moods (e.g., via simple, stylish tags using `pink-accent` sparingly [cite: 68, 327, 490, 749]), and basic duration categories[cite: 326, 328, 748, 750]. This provides an early taste of the **"Mood-Based Discovery UI"**[cite: 134, 215, 326, 637, 748, 1024].

### üìù Watchlist (Personal Curation Kickstart)
-   **Core Watchlist Functionality:** Users can add/remove titles from the recommendation feed to their personal watchlist[cite: 335, 336, 757, 758]. Interactions will be smooth with clear visual feedback[cite: 337, 759].
-   **Data Persistence:** Watchlists stored in Firestore, linked to the user's account[cite: 338, 342, 760, 764].
-   **Watchlist Display:** A dedicated `/dashboard/watchlist` page will list saved items using clean, card-based layouts consistent with **"Cinematic Minimalism with Personality"**[cite: 16, 340, 762]. Basic sorting (e.g., "Recently Added") will be available[cite: 343, 765].

### üíª App Structure & UI Foundation
-   **Theming:** Implement dark (default/recommended [cite: 17, 38, 345, 367, 389, 421, 425, 439, 460, 767, 789, 826, 847, 902]), light, and system theme support using `next-themes`[cite: 367, 371, 420, 789, 793].
-   **Landing Page:** A fully branded public marketing page built with `shadcn/ui`[cite: 354, 363, 776, 785], `MagicUI`[cite: 364, 786], `AnimateUI`[cite: 364, 786], and `AceternityUI` [cite: 370] components, introducing FilmFindr's value proposition[cite: 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774].
-   **Dashboard Layout (Basic):** A clean, intuitive layout for the `/dashboard` focusing on the recommendation feed and a watchlist quick view[cite: 359, 360, 781, 782].
-   **Responsiveness:** Ensure a fully responsive experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports[cite: 369, 390, 421, 578, 791, 965].

## üîÑ Phase 2: Social Layer & Enhanced Curation (The "Film-Savvy Friend" [cite: 11, 201, 226, 308, 390, 427, 433, 623, 648, 730, 820, 1010, 1035] Emerges)

**Goal:** Introduce core social interaction features and enhance user curation capabilities, allowing users to express their cinematic identity and engage with a like-minded community. This phase focuses on bringing the **"Playful & Engaging"** [cite: 11, 201, 213, 218, 226, 228, 232, 237, 240, 248, 253, 263, 269, 273, 279, 280, 308, 390, 400, 407, 411, 414, 427, 433, 623, 635, 640, 648, 650, 654, 659, 662, 670, 675, 685, 691, 695, 701, 730, 820, 1010, 1022, 1027, 1035, 1037, 1041, 1046, 1049, 1057, 1062, 1072, 1078, 1082, 1088] and **"Cinematic & Immersive"** [cite: 15, 201, 228, 248, 263, 277, 288, 308, 330, 365, 389, 390, 401, 421, 427, 437, 623, 650, 670, 685, 699, 710, 730, 752, 787, 824, 1010, 1037, 1057, 1072, 1086, 1097] aspects to the forefront.

### üí¨ Social Feed & Interactions
-   **User Posts:** Enable users to post reviews, quick "takes," and screenshots/images with commentary[cite: 227, 373, 375, 649, 795]. The feed will initially be a simple reverse-chronological display, potentially with liked posts surfaced.
-   **Basic Interactions:** Implement a "like" and comment system for posts[cite: 231, 374, 653, 796]. Introduce early forms of **"Emotional Reaction Tags"** [cite: 118, 231, 505, 540, 618, 653, 927, 1040] as an alternative to simple likes.

### üë§ Profiles & Community

**Goal:** Significantly enhance the AI's capabilities for deeper personalization and introduce intelligent social matching features. This phase makes the AI more palpably **"quietly brilliant"** [cite: 8, 203, 308, 321, 395, 430, 625, 743, 817, 1012] and the platform more **"Smart & Insightful"**[cite: 7, 201, 202, 207, 213, 218, 222, 232, 243, 257, 269, 277, 279, 280, 284, 292, 294, 298, 302, 308, 389, 390, 395, 396, 399, 400, 410, 415, 416, 417, 421, 427, 429, 604, 616, 623, 624, 625, 629, 635, 640, 644, 654, 663, 665, 679, 689, 691, 699, 701, 706, 707, 714, 716, 717, 720, 721, 724, 725, 730, 743, 816, 819, 900, 901, 991, 1003, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1016, 1022, 1027, 1031, 1041, 1050, 1052, 1066, 1076, 1078, 1086, 1088, 1093, 1101, 1103, 1104, 1107, 1108, 1111, 1112].

### ü§ñ FilmMatch Engine (CineMatch)
-   **Taste Compatibility:** Implement the **"Taste Matching (CineMatch)"** [cite: 267, 380, 689, 802, 1076] system to recommend users with similar or complementary taste profiles[cite: 268, 690, 1077].
-   **Compatibility Insights:** Show *why* users might match (e.g., "You both love surreal sci-fi and Studio Ghibli").
-   **"Watch Together" Suggestions (Conceptual):** Explore UI for suggesting co-viewing based on mutual watchlist items or high taste compatibility (full group watch coordination is later).

### üìà Recommendations 2.0
-   **Behavior-Driven AI:** Enhance the recommendation engine to learn from longer-term user behavior, social interactions (reactions, shared collections), and explicit feedback to provide even more nuanced and adaptive suggestions.
-   **Mood-Based Training:** Utilize explicit mood selections and implicit signals (e.g., reactions to content) to further refine mood-based recommendations and help train the engine, making the UI feel more **"emotionally smart"**[cite: 9, 203, 431, 625, 818, 1012].
-   **Light-Touch AI Personification:** Introduce subtle UI prompts for AI transparency and trust-building (e.g., "We're tuning your picks based on your recent reviews") as per the branding guide[cite: 10, 188, 211, 432, 610, 633, 819, 997, 1020].

### üß© Themed Collections & Quizzes
-   **Interactive Discovery:** Introduce the **"Themed Collections & Quizzes"** feature [cite: 13, 251, 382, 615, 673, 804, 993, 1002, 1060] allowing users to build watchlists or discover recommendations through engaging, personality-quiz-style interactions.
